    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"If you have Sweet Potatoes in the house, you will not go hungry..."</p>
    <p> At least that's what I tell myself given this economy. Don't leave the market
        without a potato peeler and nonstick recylceable baking sheets. 
        You'll need a large knife, cutting board, and oven pan ready to go.
