    <img src="./images/oatmealluck.jpeg" alt="Generic Image of Food: A Bowl of Oatmeal with 
    Fruit Toppings and Cinnamon Seasoning." height="310" width="310">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe takes like 4 minutes, max! I'm usually in a rush,
        but this is a clutch morning or midday snack for a sustained energy boost.
    </p>
    <p> It doesn't matter that the fruit is frozen. You're heating the combined ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cup Quick Rolled Oats</li>
        <li>1/4 of Ground Flaxseed </li>
        <li>1 Cup of Water</li>
        <li>A handful of Frozen Bananas and Strawberries</li>
        <li>A handful of Frozen Blueberries</li>
        <li>A handful of Frozen Peaches</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Splash of Vanilla Almond Milk (or preferred milk variation) </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure 1 Cup - or approximately a 2:1 ratio of the
            desired measurement of Quick Rolled Oats - of water. </li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil. </li>
        <li>Add oatmeal to boiling water. Stir immediately and add Cinnamon. Lower the
            burner setting to allow simmering. Avoid letting the oatmeal dry out too fast.
        </li>
        <li>Once it starts looking appetizing and edible, add the Frozen Fruit. There should
            be more than enough heat at this point.
        </li>
        <li>Grab a bowl and spoon. Have the ground flaxseed in the bowl ready to go.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked oatmeal to the bowl. Pour in the splash of Vanilla Almond Milk. Stir.</li>
        <li>Eh. That looks good enough. Bon Appetit!</li>
    </ol>
